Recommended Build Order
🔹 1. Backend Game Logic (Core Classes & API)
💡 Why first? The game logic (rules, moves, turn tracking) is the brain of your app. You want a working engine before connecting a UI.

✅ What to build:
OOP classes (Game, Board, Piece, etc.)

REST API to create a game, make a move, and get state

A few unit tests (even basic ones) to make sure moves are valid

⏳ Time frame: 2–4 sessions
🔹 2. Frontend (Chessboard UI + API Integration)
💡 Why second? Once your backend logic works, you can hook it into the frontend. This also makes it easier to debug — if the move breaks, is it the backend or UI?

✅ What to build:
Visual chessboard using chessboard.js

Move pieces and send requests to backend

Display game state (e.g. whose turn it is, invalid move messages)

⏳ Time frame: 1–2 sessions (faster with working backend)
🔹 3. Dockerize Backend & Frontend
💡 Why now? You now have both pieces working — time to containerize so they run consistently on any machine (and prepare for EKS).

✅ What to do:
Write Dockerfiles for backend & frontend

Run both locally using docker run or docker-compose

Optional: push images to Docker Hub

⏳ Time frame: 1 session
🔹 4. Kubernetes (EKS) Setup
💡 Why last? You don’t want to fight AWS errors while still debugging app logic. Deploy only once you’re confident it works in Docker.

✅ What to do:
Create Deployment, Service, Ingress YAMLs

Push images to Docker Hub or ECR

Use kubectl apply to launch on EKS

⏳ Time frame: 1–2 sessions depending on familiarity
